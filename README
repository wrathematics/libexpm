| Introduction |
\______________/

libexpm is a portable, high-performance C library for computing
the matrix exponential of a dense matrix.

Formally, a matrix exponential is the power series:

  expm(X) = I + X/1! + X^2/2! + X^3/3! + ...

To build the library, you will need:

  * Cmake 2.6
  * BLAS and LAPACK libraries.
  * R >= 2.15.0 if building the R/ subtree.

Build with make.  Both shared and static libraries will be produced
in the build/ tree.
